/*
 * Takes a signable object and a configuration struct and computes the changes to the signable necessary
 * for compliance with the signer's signing algorithm.
 *
 * This signing function currently supports only the sigv4 algorithm.
 *
 * When using this signing function to sign AWS http requests:
 *
 *   (1) Do not add the following headers to requests before signing:
 *      x-amz-content-sha256,
 *      X-Amz-Date,
 *      Authorization
 *
 *   (2) Do not add the following query params to requests before signing:
 *      X-Amz-Signature,
 *      X-Amz-Date,
 *      X-Amz-Credential,
 *      X-Amz-Algorithm,
 *      X-Amz-SignedHeaders
 *
 * The signing result will tell exactly what header and/or query params to add to the request
 * to become a fully-signed AWS http request.
 *
 *
 * When using this signing function to sign chunks:
 *
 *   (1) The signable should be a wrapper around the chunk's input stream
 *   (2) The most-recently-computed signature value (original request or most recent chunk) must be the
 *       "previous-signature" property on the signable.
 *
 * The signing result will include the chunk's signature as the "signature" property.
 *
 *
 * When using this function to sign events:
 *
 *   (1) The signable should be a wrapper around the event's payloads and headers.  TBD: forbid :date and calculate
 *       it based on the config's date value?
 *   (2) The most-recently-computed signature value (original request or most recent chunk) must be the
 *       "previous-signature" property on the signable.
 *
 * The signing result will include the chunk's signature as the "signature" property, where it should be added
 * to the event as the value of the ":chunk-signature" header.
